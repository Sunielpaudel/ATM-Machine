# ATM System Project

## Project Description

The ATM System project simulates the functionality of an ATM, allowing users to interact with accounts for basic banking operations. The system provides functionalities such as logging into an account, checking balance, depositing and withdrawing money, transferring funds between accounts, viewing transaction history, and sorting accounts by balance. The project also includes a mechanism to load and save account data from/to a file, enabling data persistence across sessions.

This project is built using C++ and demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. It also focuses on file handling to load and save account data.

## Objectives

- **Account Management**: The system should handle basic ATM functions, such as logging in with an account number and password, checking the balance, and performing deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Transaction History**: The system should maintain a transaction history for each account, capturing every deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.
- **Account Sorting**: The ATM system allows sorting accounts by balance to view the richest accounts first.
- **Account Search**: The system allows searching for accounts by account holder's name.
- **Data Persistence**: The system supports loading account data from a file and saving updated data back to the file after transactions, ensuring data persistence.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system features a simple, text-based interface for users to interact with, making it easy to perform banking operations.

## Features

1. **Login System**: Users can log in by entering their account number and password.
2. **Balance Check**: Users can check the current balance of their account.
3. **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account.
4. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw money from their account.
5. **Transfer Funds**: Users can transfer money between their account and other accounts.
6. **Transaction History**: Users can view the history of their transactions.
7. **Account Sorting**: Accounts can be sorted by balance to see the highest or lowest balance accounts.
8. **Account Search**: Users can search for accounts by name to find the account information.
9. **Data Persistence**: All account details (including transactions) are saved in a file (`accounts.dat`) so that they persist between program runs.
